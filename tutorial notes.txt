Python is different from C
Spacing is important, but no semicolons ;

function definition is 

    def message_box(subject, content):
        pass

you need the indented block, default to pass, or it won't let you do anything until it sees one


and if statements don't use && ||

    if (((ball.xcor() > 340) and (ball.xcor() < 350)) and ((ball.ycor() > (paddle_b.ycor()-50)) and (ball.ycor() < (paddle_b.ycor()+50)))):
            ball.dx *= -1

Which I'm not that big a fan of.

You also don't have to declare types on variables, which still bothers me conceptually.

Virtual environments
!! most important commands for venv !! (go into bash first)
Navigate to a dedicated directory for virtual environments
>virtualenv projectenv
>source projectenv/bin/activate

!!to stay in fish, run this one!!
╭─eein@CYBERDRAGON in ~/Documents/Lab/Code/Python Stuffs via  v3.9.5 
╰─λ source "/home/eein/Documents/Lab/Code/Python Stuffs/env_1/bin/activate.fish"

source "/home/eein/Documents/Lab/Code/Python Stuffs/env_2_snake/bin/activate.fish"

This Activates the Virtual Environment. the name should be an indicator
(project2_env) [eein@CYBERDRAGON Environments]$

>which python
>which pip

Note:
Be Careful When rearranging files and folders wrt virual environments.
the >source commands requires a location and you'll have to update that too.


Note:
Any package you add to a virtual environment should first be added to your true python installation.

Otherwise the VSCode run command won't work it
Truthfully, you can't run a python script in the venv without running 
>python -u "file.py"

While the terminal is inside the venv
Or at least that's what I'm gathering

PyLint is annoying. Disable it by CTRL SHIFT P, Python:Enable Linting, off
