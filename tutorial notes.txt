Python is different from C
Spacing is important, but no semicolons ;

function definition is 

    def message_box(subject, content):
        pass

and if statements don't use && ||

    if (((ball.xcor() > 340) and (ball.xcor() < 350)) and ((ball.ycor() > (paddle_b.ycor()-50)) and (ball.ycor() < (paddle_b.ycor()+50)))):
            ball.dx *= -1

Which I'm not that big a fan of.

You also don't have to declare types on variables, which still bothers me conceptually.
